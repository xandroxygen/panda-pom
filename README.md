# PandaPom

> A productivity timer that uses the Pomodoro technique

PandaPom is a Pomodoro timer that lets you set a goal for each day, and track your progress to that goal. It's built with Vue, Bulma, and Nuxt.

## Development

To start PandaPom locally, run 

```
yarn nuxt
```

## Deployment

To deploy PandaPom to `inseng`, run

```
vaulted shell inseng
./deploy.sh
```

If you have no clue what `inseng` is, then you probably shouldn't deploy this 🤷🏻‍
